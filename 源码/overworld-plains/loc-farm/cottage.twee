	"What other choice did I have...?" <<he>> asks, starting to tear up. "It's not like there's anywhere for us to raise a kid out here..."
	<br><br>

	<<He>> wipes <<his>> tears away with a sleeve. "Look, I can't stand the idea of my kids somewhere out there, livin' as orphans, but I've already got a farm to run, and that keeps my hands full enough as it is."
	<br><br>

	"Even if we asked for 'em back, we'd need somewhere to take care of 'em, like that <span class="blue">nursery</span> I mentioned to you before. You'd also have to go ask <span class="red">that caretaker</span> yourself, since I can't take any time away from the farm..." <<he>> says.

"Pa is kind of busy right now, but he said mother's at the city and that she agreed to help us, it shouldn't take long," <<he>> says looking more excited than before.
<br><br>

You don't have to wait much until a vehicle approaches and honks.
<br>

Alex's mother waves at you two.
<br><br>

Alex opens the door for you and helps you get in, entering from the other side and taking a seat next to you when you're in.
<br><br>

"My little <<if $NPCName[$NPCNameList.indexOf("Alex")].pronoun is "f">>girl<<else>>boy<</if>> is finally settling down," she laughs.
<br>

Alex blushes and turns <<his>> faces away.
<br><br>

"And with such a <<if $player.gender_appearance is "f">>beautiful woman<<else>>handsome man<</if>>" she adds.
<br><br>

"Mum!" Alex protests.
<br>

"What? I was telling the truth," she plays. You don't think Alex's face could get more red.

"Could you please go and get <<if childrenCountBetweenParents("pc","Alex") gte 2>>them<<else>>it<</if>>?" Alex asks. "I'm not sure if I can go in there."
<br><br>

You nod and enter the orphanage, going right to the Nursery. The goon, that guards the entrance, doesn't stop you as you enter, take your <<if childrenCountBetweenParents("pc","Alex") gte 2>>children<<else>>child<</if>> and leave.
<br><br>

Looking to your right, you notice Bailey starting you from <<nnpc_his "Bailey">> office, while some orphans steal glances at you and your <<if childrenCountBetweenParents("pc","Alex") gte 2>>babies<<else>>baby<</if>>, as if surprised that someone actually got out of that place.
<br><br>

Alex opens the door for you and you get in, still with your <<if childrenCountBetweenParents("pc","Alex") gte 2>>babies<<else>>baby<</if>> in hands.

It's not a long trip, and you soon arrive at the farm.

Alex helps you leave the vehicle and take your <<if childrenCountBetweenParents("pc","Alex") is 1>>child<<else>>children<</if>> to the cottage's nursery.

Alex's mother turns to Alex. "I need to get back to work now, but listen, I'm proud of you, you're making this place look like a home," she says as she drives away.
