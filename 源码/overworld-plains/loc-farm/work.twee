You are on Alex's farm. A rustic farmhouse overlooks a yard and chicken coop. Other buildings nestle between trees and hedgerows.
<<if $exhibitionism lt 75 and $exposed gte 2 and $farm_naked is 1>>
	With so many places to hide your <<lewdness>>, you do your best to avoid exposing yourself and avoid Alex where you can.
