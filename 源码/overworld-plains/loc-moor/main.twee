Inside is a black iron bell. The exterior is marked with symbols common at the temple. Was it stolen? It's even heavier than it looks. You ring it. At first there's no sound, and you wonder if it still works. Then a deep, sonorous toll rings out. Dread washes over you. You shiver.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
