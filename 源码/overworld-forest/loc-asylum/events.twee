"You're wrong," you say. "People keep forcing themselves on me."

<<He>> shakes <<his>> head. "There's no fault," <<he>> says. "But you understand. People are responding to your provocation. The way you dress and carry yourself. Most people aren't as talented." <<He>> glances at the clock. "That's all for today. Be well."

"The tentacles are real," you say. "I felt them all over me. They left marks and goo..."
