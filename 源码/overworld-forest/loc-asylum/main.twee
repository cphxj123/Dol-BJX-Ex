You return to the patient's area, taking cover in alcoves whenever frantic security run by. You arrive, and behold a scene of chaos. Cell doors stand open, their occupants loose. Some members of security have already fallen, their uniforms stripped. Several patients assault each one. Their colleagues try to rescue them, but their batons are no match for the patient's numbers and lust. Many of the patients satisfy themselves with the fallen security personnel, but others fuck each other on tables, chairs or just the floor.
<br><br>
You look out the window. The towers are unmanned and the patrols missing as all hands arrive to contain the threat. Doctor Harper enters from a door opposite, surrounded by security. Now's your chance.
<br><br>
You run through the front door unobstructed, and across the grounds. You climb the fence and escape into the forest.

You awaken in another room. You hear faint whimpering. A smiling midwife stands beside your bed,
<<if $litter_size is 1>>
	holding a bundled _baby_type pup in <<his>> arms.
	<br><br>

	"Looks like mummy's awake," <<he>> says, passing you the pup. They sit in your arms, eyes shut, chest rising and falling with gentle breaths.
	<br><br>

	"We've run all the tests," the midwife says. "There's not a single health problem. Have you thought of a name?"

	pushing a cot with <<number $litter_size>> _baby_type pups inside.

	"Looks like mummy's awake," <<he>> says, pushing the cot into your reach. You hold them one by one, their eyes shut, chests rising and falling with gentle breaths.

	"We've run all the tests," the midwife says. "There's not a single health problem. Have you thought of their names?" the midwife asks.

	You feel your insides drop as you stand, but <<he>> assures you that's normal.
	<br><br>

	Despite the pain, you feel a lot more comfortable walking than you did before the birth. You'd forgotten how easy it is to move without wolves inside you.

	You get walking again quite easily. It's a little awkward, but the transition isn't as bad as it used to be. It's still easier to move around when there isn't a litter of wolves inside you.

	The midwife still insists on helping you dress.

	You stand up without a hitch. There's hardly any difference in feeling anymore, although you do feel much more nimble.

<<elseif playerNormalPregnancyTotal() gte 50>>
	You stand up without assistace, feeling empty inside. You already miss the feeling of being pregnant.
	<br><br>

	<<He>> stares at you, mouth agape, as you walk without any assistance. You throw your clothes back on quickly.
	<br><br>

	"Y-you should be good to go," <<he>> says.

"The pups will be released into the forest once they can fend for themselves."
