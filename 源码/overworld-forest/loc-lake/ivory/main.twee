<br><br>
"You did it! I knew you could do it!" <<He>> speaks in a language you don't know, and yet, you find yourself understanding the words. Another voice speaks in unison.

The pale figure holds you close.

You're in the middle of a large cathedral. Tables are set up for a great feast.
All around you, faces you

They're all surrounded by a pale glow. The longer you look, the more translucent they become.
<br><br>
"<span class="wraith">But for now, we are whole again. Enjoy it. Like sand slipping through our fingers.</span>"
<br><br>
You find yourself returning the embrace. You don't want to let go. The inner warmth begins to fade, and the faces around you become unrecognisable. They begin to distort into unnatural shapes. You're instantly filled with panic. The pale figure slips backwards, out of your reach.
<br><br>
The tapestries on the walls peel away, revealing utter emptiness as the figures fall to the ground, clutching the sides of their heads where their ears used to be. A bell tolls.
<br><br>
<<His>> skin turns marble white once again, and <<he>> begins to fade away. The faint <<wraithEyes>> light of <<his>> eyes flicker out in a rapidly expanding darkness.
<br><br>
"<span class="wraith">Remember us, <<pcpetname "Wraith" "nice">>, not as we are, but as how we were.</span>"
<br><br>
As the light draws away, you begin to fall. You can't hear wind in your ears, or against your skin, but somehow you know you're falling. Snowflakes and shards of glass brush past, mingling and dissolving.

You open your mouth.

	You try to ask why. Why it follows you, why it torments you. Why it seeks you specifically, and why it brought you here.

The words fail to form. But still, a response comes.
