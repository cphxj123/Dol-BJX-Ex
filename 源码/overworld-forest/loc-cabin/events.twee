to <<him>>.

Turning around, you release a sigh as <<he>> scrubs it over your skin. The sensation of <<his>> firm hands sliding over your muscles is surprisingly relaxing,
and you find your eyes closing as you sink into <<his>> arms.
<br><br>

Leaning back against <<him>>, you feel yourself drift off as Eden trails the sponge over your body. <<His>> hands roam from your back, to your chest, and down to your legs.
<br><br>

With each stroke, you feel the stress of the day melt away from <<his>> touch, and you let out an involuntary moan in response. Eden chuckles softly at the sound, <<his>> gaze tender as <<he>> traces <<his>> eyes over your form.

You wake up some time later, head resting on Eden's chest. The water feels much colder now, and you can't help but wonder why <<he>> hasn't left the tub yet.
Then again, with the warmth of <<his>> arms wrapped around you, you don't really mind.
<br><br>

Feeling you shift, Eden glances down at you, slowly stroking your thigh. "I thought I'd let you sleep," <<he>> says. It's almost like <<he>> read your mind.
<br><br>

Even as the sky darkens, you can't help but sink into <<his>> embrace, the both of you not wanting to leave each other just yet. Pressed against <<him>>, the thumping of Eden's heart is only accompanied
by the occasional sound of the water sloshing about.
<br><br>

"Thanks," you say, shifting yourself even closer to Eden. Your voice rings clear through the peaceful serenity of the cabin.
<<Hes>> silent, but you feel <<his>> hand slide up from your thigh, until <<he>> intertwines <<his>> fingers with yours. It takes a second, but <<he>> gives your hand a gentle squeeze.
With your ear pressed against <<his>> chest, you swear you can hear <<his>> heart beat faster, and you smile. In the midst of the silence, <<hes>> just told you a thousand words.

As content as the both of you are to remain in the moment, the day's not over yet. Pulling away, Eden assists you in climbing out of the water, and you take a moment to stabilise yourself as your unsteady feet hit the floor.

You tell Eden about your grievances. It starts out small at first. You begin by describing how you've been continuously approached. Somehow, in the minutes that pass, the conversation spirals into you detailing about the suffering you've gone through.
About how you're so overwhelmed by everything. You're vaguely aware that you've started crying.
<br><br>

Eden's touch brings you back to reality. <<He>> gently swipes <<his>> thumb over your cheeks in an attempt to dry them. You look up at <<him>> through your sobs. Though blurred by tears, <<his>> face is still visible. A storm of emotions swirl in <<his>> eyes.
<<He>> pulls you into <<his>> chest as your crying subsides. You breathe in <<his>> scent. It's comforting.

You and Eden stay curled up by the fire for some time. The silence is only broken by the crackling of embers and your sniffling. Eventually, Eden tries to speak. <<He>> stutters through <<his>> words, starting and breaking off sentences.
After a few attempts, <<he>> manages to get something out.
<br><br>

"I don't know what to say." <<His>> voice sounds disbelieving, sad, and angry. You're not sure if <<his>> anger is directed at your attackers, or at <<him>>self. "I should have been there," <<he>> says, holding you tighter. "I should have protected you." Tighter.
"I should have shot anyone who even tried to touch you." <<His>> hold is almost painful now. "I should have-" You wince at the strength of <<his>> embrace. Eden immediately loosens <<his>> hold on you and goes quiet again.
<br><br>

It takes a bit, but you eventually summon the energy to speak. In a whisper, you tell <<him>> that it's okay. That <<he>> doesn't need to blame <<him>>self for anything you went through. Eden pulls a conflicted expression at your words. "I don't know how to help you," <<he>> says.
"I wish I could have done something. Anything." <<He>> starts to squeeze you again, but stops <<him>>self. You could be imagining it, but it feels like <<his>> arms are trembling.

Eden tries to retort, but looks away and sighs. "Fine," <<he>> says. "I won't stop you." You smile weakly at <<him>> and bury your face in <<his>> chest. <<He>> strokes your hair in response.
For a moment, the both of you stay silent, content to remain tangled in each other's arms. The peace is momentarily broken by the sound of Eden's voice. "I'm here if you need me," <<he>> says.
You nod. The two of you watch the embers crackle into the night.

Suddenly, you notice that the once distant sound of chatter has disappeared. Looking around, you see nothing but trees and deduce that Eden must have brought the two of you into a relatively private section of the lake.
You turn your attention to <<him>>, realising that, in this moment, there is nothing but you, Eden and the beautiful <<if Time.season is "autumn">>falling leaves<<elseif Time.hour gte 6 and Time.hour lte 8>>sunset<<else>>sky<</if>>.

Slowly, you shuffle closer to Eden. <<He>> looks confused, until you take <<him>> by surprise and capture <<his>> lips in a sweet kiss. For a second, <<he>> turns stiff, shocked at your bold actions, before <<he>> kisses you back with just as much force.
When the two of you break apart, <<he>> chuckles, shaking <<his>> head and turning to look at the <<if Time.season is "autumn">>falling autumn leaves<<elseif Time.hour gte 6 and Time.hour lte 8>>sunset<<else>>sky<</if>>. It really is a gorgeous sight, and you think Eden agrees.

<<He>> settles down with an exhausted groan, clearly worn out from the work <<he>> did, and <<his>> tussle with the wolves. You scurry around the cabin, grabbing a washcloth and a roll of bandages.
<br><br>

Carefully, you lift Eden's shirt over <<his>> head, peeling off the damp fabric. <<His>> body is caked with dirt and sweat. Using the damp washcloth, you gently wipe down <<his>> skin.
Upon closer inspection, <<his>> wounds are thankfully rather shallow. Despite this, your hands shake with nervousness as you work.
Setting the washcloth aside, you reach for the bandages sitting on the table. Just as your hand hovers over them, Eden stops you, grabbing your arm. <<His>> grip is firm, but gentle.

Rushing to a nearby cabinet, you grab one of the jars and return to Eden. Gathering some on your fingers, you carefully apply the salve to <<his>> deeper wounds. Eden releases a small hiss at the pain, but otherwise doesn't stop you.
Taking the hint, you continue, making sure to apply the salve as gently as possible. Over time, Eden starts to relax at your soft touch. In fact, by the time you're done, <<hes>> almost dozing off.
