You walk among the students and examine their projects. Some are more impressive than others. One is just an essay taped to a board. Another looks more like an art project.
<br><br>

The public are allowed in. They roam between the displays, asking questions and flirting inappropriately with students.
<br><br>

Leighton walks on stage and taps the microphone. Sirris stands beside <<him>>. "Thank you, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, for coming," <<he>> says. "I've seen some fine work already. Sirris and I will judge. Be patient."
<br><br>

Leighton and Sirris leave the stage and begin to circle around the room. Leighton criticises the projects. Sirris observes, but gives words of encouragement if Leighton was particularly scathing. Still, some students are left tearful by the headteacher's remarks.
<br><br>

After conferring they announce that a <<person2>><<person>> with a flower display is the winner.
<br><br>

Leighton herds you and the other students from the hall. You might have learned something.
