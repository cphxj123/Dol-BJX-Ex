	You sit back and admire your work. You feel a strange heat just beneath your skin. It grows and spreads through your body, concentrated on your loins. Lewd fantasies force themselves into your mind. Within moments, your cheeks are flushed and you find yourself squirming with desire. That dose must have been contaminated by a concentrated aphrodisiac.

	Your hands wander between your legs in an instinctive attempt to satisfy your burning desire. But the stimulation from touching yourself is too strong to bear. The pleasure shoots through you, painfully intense. Your hands recoil, and your whole body convulses as your vision whites out. The aftershocks leave you trembling. There's no way you'll be able to use your hands to comfort yourself.
	<br><br>
	You consider leaving your room for some fresh air. But your mind is so overwhelmed by desire. You can only imagine what will happen when someone finds you in your defenceless state. And the alternative, staying here and trying to endure the arousal until it fades, feels like it might be even worse.

	You realise how little you managed to keep up. Enough to keep your privates concealed, but everyone can see what you're wearing beneath. You feel blood rush to your face.

	You feel around with your free hand and find it. A wire is attached to your bottoms. It must be looped around something beneath the stage. The tugging at the back and sides suggests there are more than one.

You grasp the hem of your $worn.lower.name with both hands as Whitney and <<his>> friends tug. You manage to prevent them from revealing your <span class="pink"><<undies>></span> to the audience, but the fabric covering you becomes even tighter.
<br><br>

The audience is alive with excitement. Some look away, but most stare in astonishment, or pull phones from their pockets.

The photographer now darts around in front of the stage, taking pictures of the struggle from every angle. Perhaps waiting for the moment you're exposed in front of everyone.

Whitney and friends stop pulling for a moment, but only to reposition in the aisle so they can put their backs into it. The force almost lifts you off the ground.
<br><br>

You feel a slackness as one of the wires snaps, soon followed by the others. Whitney and <<his>> friends fall backwards. You almost fall over yourself. Your skirt floats back where it belongs. You spend a few moments removing the hooks.

You pass the judges on the way down from the stage. You take your seat and wait for their decision.
