        <<case 2>>
            You are starting to sweat, despite the cool air on your skin. There's no sign of Whitney yet, and a small crowd has formed around you.

            A larger crowd has now surrounded you. Almost everyone has their phones out, taking pictures and videos. You're so embarrassed, you wonder how long you can stand like that, with the whole city seeing you like this.

            You are shaking with embarrassment. The crowd has grown larger. All you can hear are their taunts and jeers and shouts. A few have even gotten bold enough to run up and give you a spank on your bare ass. It would be easy to end this, but you obediently still haven't covered yourself.

You throw one end of the rope over the edge of the hole, and tie the other around a sturdy girder. You tug it to make sure it's safe, then descend.

You hold the rope in your hands, and press your weight against the building with your feet. You stop to wait for the wind to die down now and then.

You soon reach the mist, and continue through it. The rope just about reaches the ground.
