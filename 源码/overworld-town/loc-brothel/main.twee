Patrons ogle and cheer at them, waited on by other staff in various states of undress. You are led through the room and through an inconspicuous door. A flight of stairs later and you find yourself in a lavishly-decorated office.
<br><br>

<<He>> lies down on a velvet sofa in the middle of the room, props <<his>> head up with one arm and observes you. You look around for a place to sit but other than the sofa there's no seating. <<He>> interrupts your search. "My name is Briar. Welcome to my establishment."

Briar whispers into one of the guard's ears, and <<he>> nods. You're quickly blindfolded and brought down the stairs, through a hallway.
<br><br>

You feel the <<if $weather is "overcast" or $weather is "clear">>wind<<else>>$weather<</if>> on your face. You're outside. You're quickly shoved into a car, which takes off after a few seconds.
<br><br>

After about ten minutes of silence, Briar speaks. You weren't aware <<he>> was even in the car with you. "When I let someone under my roof, it's me extending my trust. Do you know what I mean? There's an unspoken agreement that I provide for you, and you don't mess things up for me. So when that trust is broken, it hurts."
<br><br>

<<He>> lets out a deep breath. "What I'm saying is, you hurt me. And it's hard to get past that. I don't forgive you... but I will. Just as soon as they're done with you."
<br><br>

The car comes to a stop, and Briar pulls you out. "I like avoiding this place. It's too..." <<he>> searches for a word. "Unprofitable, for my tastes. But for cases like these, it's well worth it." Another pair of hands grabs you and pulls you through a doorway, removing your blindfold. You hear, and see, the car pull away before the door closes.

If you don't have time to buy products every week, you need money to refill the machine with a lot of them. If you don't have enough money to fully restock the machine, you need the time to top it off a little bit every week." Briar takes some bills out of a drawer. "But you were lucky.
