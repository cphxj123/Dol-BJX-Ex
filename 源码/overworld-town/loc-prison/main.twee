You get a static shock when you wipe away the grime.

You stand in front of the beacon, and hold up the egg. One <<beasttype>> notices, hops in excitement, and sings. This gets the others' attention. They rise from their nests and join the chorus. One swoops down and lifts you from your feet.

<<bHe>> carries you up to the beacon, and gently places you beside the empty nest. Others land, forming a circle around you.
