You awaken in a dim room. An iron collar is fastened around your neck. You're tied and bound to a chair, facing an open door. A small window near the ceiling lets in a little light, but more illuminating is the naked bulb hanging above a second chair, hosting a laptop. The bulb flickers, and fails.
<br><br>

"M-my love?" croons a voice from the dark. The light flickers back on, revealing Kylar stood before you. You didn't hear any footsteps. <span class="pink"><<Hes>> holding a knife.</span> <<His>> knuckles are white.
<br><br>
"<<kylar_pet_name cap>> is awake!" <<He>> drops to <<his>> knees in front of you, and kicks the door shut behind <<him>>. "<<kylar_pet_name cap>> is awake and all mine."<<gggdom>><<lllksuspicion>>
<br><br>

<i>Kylar's eyes are alight with a restrained madness. You can't read <<him>> at all.</i>
