The interior is spacious, just as fancy as the rest of the hotel. It's less a room, and more a suite, complete with a balcony and what looks like a hot tub. There's also a very large bed. You sit on it. It's so soft compared to those at the orphanage. You bounce on your <<bottom>>.

Avery's eyes narrow. "Acting aloof, are we? You won't get far in this world with this kind of attitude. You'll find out soon. Just a friendly warning, from you to me."
<br><br>

The rest of the trip passes in silence. Finally, the helicopter descends near an estate on Danube Street. The security jump out, and Avery follows them without so much as throwing a glance back at you.

		"Well, that certainly was a nice trip, don't you agree? As it happens to be, we're already there."
		<br><br>

		The helicopter touches down on an impressive estate at Danube Street, greeted by staff. The security jump out, and a mighty hubbub ensues. Avery climbs out of the helicopter.
		<br><br>

		"I trust you can walk the rest of the way yourself? It's not far. I'll see you again."

		<br><br>

		Avery gives a command to the pilot, and the helicopter makes for the park. It touches down in a wide open area. Avery opens the door.
		<br><br>

		"Now get off before I have the security drag you out. And better behave next time. I hope we got this straight."
		<br><br>

		Avery slams the door shut behind you, and the helicopter ascends once more.

You slap the glass aside with force. Its contents are splattered gratuitously over the seats and Avery's suit. <<His>> face turns a deep shade of red.

"You little minx! Look what you've done! Are you lacking even the most basic forms of upbringing? Gah, it can't be helped! I need to get changed! But first to get rid of you! Be glad I don't have time to deal with you properly!"

Avery calls the pilot to head back. The helicopter descends in the park, just shy of touching the ground, and Avery unceremoniously pushes you out.<<gpain>><<violence 3>>

Face buried in the dirt, you watch Avery's helicopter head back to the office.
