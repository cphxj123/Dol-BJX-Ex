	You awaken on a hard metallic surface in a dark room.
<</if>>
Dim lights along the walls switch on, illuminating a large and grimy room, the ceiling lost in the darkness above. Cages line one wall, full of golden eyes that stare out at you. The cage doors shift slightly, and a timer blinks into life "1:00, 0:59, 0:58..." Fighting back panic, you head to the door on the other side of the room, which appears to be the only way out.
<br><br>

Through the door and to the left there is a precipitous drop. You peer down and see dark running water; you can vaguely make out a wide tunnel leading away from the bottom. To the right is a long corridor. A door stands shut at the other end. In front of you is a small hole in the wall, which you might be able to squeeze through.

The nurse keeps glancing at you, looking concerned.
	<br><br>

	Sydney looks uneasy. "We need to leave." You find yourself unable to respond. The nurse moves towards Sydney, who pulls you away. "No." The nurse freezes in place as Sydney glares.
	<br><br>

	"Sydney, I assure you that-"
	<br>
	"Everything will be fine? No it won't. We're leaving, and you can't stop us." The nurse grabs Sydney by the arms and holds <<person1>><<him>> back. <<He>> pushes back with surprising strength, but is too slow. The doctor presses a cloth to your face, and a haze falls on you. You hear a yell in Sydney's voice, and everything begins to spin. You feel yourself pulled along, and more yelling.
	<br><br>
	Once out in the corridor multiple shapes march toward you. Someone blocks their path. The one holding you doesn't stop. They lead you outside and into the back of a waiting car as your consciousness slips.

:: Hospital Sydney Rescue
<<effects>>
You awaken once more, your head spinning. Two figures are talking in the front seats. You slowly begin to recognise them. It's Sydney, and Sirris. <<npc "Sydney" 1>><<person1>><<npc "Sirris" 2>><<person2>>
<br><br>
"There, see? I told you they'd be okay, Syd." You notice you're no longer in front of the hospital, but on Elk Street.
<br><br>
Sydney practically jumps out of the car, only to open the rear door and jump in, tackle-hugging you into the seat. "I was so worried once <<nnpc_he "Harper">> got that cloth on you." You think about asking Sydney what happened, but the words simply won't form. You mindlessly return the hug.
<br><br>
"Alright, get comfortable back there, you two. Sydney, seatbelt! And you wonder why you can't get your license.
<<if !$sydneySeen.includes("ride")>>
	<<set $sydneySeen.pushUnique("ride")>>
	So, where do you live?" Sirris leans back over the seat to look at you.
	<br><br>
	You answer Sirris in a monotone, giving flawless directions to the orphanage. You think you see a sympathetic frown, but you're not sure.
<<else>>
	The ride won't take long since I know where to go now."
<</if>>
Sirris keeps shooting concerned looks at you through the rear mirror. Sydney refuses to let go of you until you get to the orphanage, at which point you both exit the car.
<br><br>
Sydney walks you to the front door of the orphanage, and <<if $sydneyromance is 1>>kisses you on the cheek<<else>>hugs you<</if>>.
"Be careful around that doctor. Don't trust a word <<nnpc_he "Harper">> says."
<br><br>
You watch Sydney walk back to the car, and they both wait for you to go inside before leaving.

:: Hospital Journey Home Sydney
<<effects>>
Sydney leads you out of the hospital, into a waiting car. Sirris waits in the driver's seat. <<npc "Sydney" 1>><<person1>><<npc "Sirris" 2>><<person2>>
"You two are quite the handful. Everything alright?" <<He>> looks at you. "Sydney refused to leave your side the whole time. I would have stayed too, had time permitted. Sydney, buckle up or you'll never get your license." Sydney pouts.
<<if !$sydneySeen.includes("ride")>>

	"The ride won't take long since I know where to go now."

Sirris keeps shooting concerned looks at you through the rear mirror. You reach the orphanage quickly, and Sydney exits the car to take your hand.
