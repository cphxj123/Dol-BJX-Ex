<<person1>>Doren turns to you once outside the station. "I'm so sorry," <<he>> says. "I thought they'd be more helpful. Now I've just stressed you for no reason." <<He>> looks up and behind you, at one of the tall buildings on the street. "I know." <<He>> takes you by the hand and leads you towards it.
<br><br>
You climb to the fifth floor. Doren unlocks one of the doors along the corridor and holds it open for you. The interior is quite spartan. There's an old television covered in a film of dust and a sofa, but little else. "This is my flat," <<he>> says. "I only really come here to sleep. I like being out and about." <<He>> walks over to the closed blinds and lets the light in. "I didn't know where else to take you. I can't just forget what you told me." <<He>> walks over to what you think is the kitchen. "Make yourself at home. Just gonna get a drink."
<br><br>
You sit on the sofa, disturbing some dust. Doren sits beside you and passes you a glass of water.

:: Doren Intro Cry

<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "town">><<effects>>
Feeling safe, you cry in <<his>> arms. As the sobs subside you share some of the horrible things people have done to you. It's painful to talk about, but you feel cathartic afterwards.

<br><br>
Doren pulls away from you and smiles. "I need to get back to school or I'll be in trouble." You look at the clock on the wall and realise a whole hour has passed. "I'm not home often, but if you visit between four and five in the afternoon I should be here. Visit as often as you like. Every day if you want. I mean it."
<br><br>
<<He>> drives you back to school and waves goodbye in the front courtyard. You feel guilty for having spent so much of <<his>> time, but <<he>> doesn't seem to mind.

	You climb to Doren's flat and knock on the door. <<npc Doren>><<person1>><<He>> answers it, smiling. "Glad to see you! Come on in." You enter the flat and sit on the sofa. "What would you like to do?" <<he>> says.

Doren puts on a pair of running shoes. "Don't worry, we're not gonna go hard."
<br><br>
Together you jog around town. <<He>> shows you several paths through alleyways you didn't know existed. "It's great to have some company," <<he>> says at one point.
<br><br>
<<He>> stops beside the toilets in the park. "Just need a quick break. Won't be long." You're thankful for a break yourself.

	You're waiting outside when a <<generate2>><<person2>><<person>> walks up to you. "Hey <<girl>>, you all alone?" <<he>> says, resting an arm next to your head. <<He>> glances around to see if anyone's watching. "How about we find somewhere private?"
	<br><br>
	<<He>> tries to pull you into the toilets, just as Doren comes out. <<person1>>Doren takes one look at the <<person2>><<person>>, then punches <<him>> in the jaw.
	<br><br>
	The <<person>> falls backwards, clutching <<his>> face. Doren stands over <<him>> and grabs <<his>> collar. "Stay the fuck away from <<phim>> you creep, or I'll twist your head right off. Come on, let's go before someone sees. Might look bad."
	<br><br>
<<else>>
	<<He>> didn't lie, and is back in less than a minute. "Come on <<lass>>, no time to waste!" You jog after <<him>>.

You continue to jog through town, and end up back at Barb Street. You stop outside Doren's building. "Thanks for coming along," <<he>> pants. "You can come up and shower if you like. I don't mind waiting."

You enter the bathroom and strip. You notice there's only one towel on the rack.

You leave your clothes in the bathroom and step into the hallway, feeling a thrill as you do. You walk to the front room, where Doren is still taking off <<his>> shoes. "Need something la..." <<he>> cuts off as soon as <<he>> looks up and sees you, <<lewdness>> on display. "I think you, ah, forgot something." <<He>> averts <<his>> gaze.

"Of course," <<he>> says. "I forget that's something people might want." <<He>> gets a fresh towel from the kitchen, and stares at the corner of the room while handing it to you. "You do realise you're naked, right?"
<br><br>
<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
	"It's fine. I feel safe here, with you," you reply, smiling shyly.

<<else>>
	"Yes. I hope you don't mind." you reply.

"It's not a problem," <<he>> says, still not looking at you. "Just caught me off guard is all."
<br><br>
You return to the shower and wash until you're squeaky clean.

Doren smiles at you on the way out. "Come back tomorrow if you like."
