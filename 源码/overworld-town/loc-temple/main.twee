Jordan kneels once more, but this time <<he>> feels along the ground beside it. <<He>> pries loose a stone brick, and reaches into a revealed chamber. A bell is lifted out without a sound. The priest holds it carefully as <<he>> produces a baton from <<his>> robe.
<br><br>

The baton strikes the bell. It only makes a gentle jingle, but most of the resonance doesn't pass through the air. Jordan's arm quivers, and you feel it enter your feet, rooting you to the spot and traveling up your spine as a shiver of ecstasy.
<br><br>

You hear a heavy door open. Three <<monks_and_nuns>> ascend a staircase, and gaze at the spear with naked awe. Until Jordan coughs. One of them, a <<person2>><<monk>>, takes the spear with careful hands.

You tell Jordan about the ghostly figure <<if $wraith.state is "haunt">>that's been tormenting you<<else>>that you've encountered<</if>>. You describe what you've seen it do, and where you've seen it. Jordan winces at a few of the details.
<br><br>

<<He>> stays silent for a long time. <<He>> slowly turns to you, and gives a deep sigh. "It's not a pleasant story. It predates the founding of our order, but was instrumental in it." Jordan gestures for you to walk with <<him>>. You follow as <<he>> continues.
<br><br>

"Centuries ago, there was a monastic schism. A disagreement between beliefs. One group eventually went on to found the temple we stand in now. The other dissolved." Jordan stares at the angels lining the walls. "We know nothing of their names, and precious little about what really happened. There are only stories." <<He>> continues walking.
<br><br>

"There was another temple in the forest, not too far from here. It was supposedly the site for a terrible, heretical ritual that was countered by my predecessors. What the intent was, we may never know. Whatever happened, it had dire consequences. Some say it was this, and not the ravages of time, that sunk the old temple into the lake." Jordan keeps walking, brushing <<his>> hands against an angelic statue. The angel has six arms, and many wings. You feel oddly calm.

Oddly, they appear very rarely in any records. Once again, we know very little." You catch a hint of sadness in <<his>> voice.
<br><br>

"There's one constant through all their appearances. They always wore a precious piece of jewelry, believed to have divine significance. It was a necklace,
<<if ["haunt", "despair"].includes($wraith.state)>>

	carved from ivory, and set with large sapphires."
<</if>>
<br><br>

"Throughout history, there are accounts of sightings. A beautiful, pale man or woman under the harvest moon, clutching that necklace. It's something of a legend now, I suppose. Some say it's a shared hallucination of some kind." Jordan turns to you, looking very serious.
<br><br>

"If you choose to investigate, please be careful. Hallucinations are real enough to those that see them." Jordan turns away, and leaves.

Jordan leads you down a flight of steps, and through a thick wooden door. Modern lights illuminate ancient walls, etched with archaic writing. The priest doesn't slow a step, and continues down a passage. You pass other doors, hearing the sound of metal clanging behind some, and the smells of strange incenses seeping between the cracks of others.

The priest still doesn't slow <<his>> steps as <<he>> speaks, giving you no chance to investigate.

however, a bell echoes through the cloister. Jordan has produced the instrument, and a hammer, from <<person1>><<his>> robes.

"Initiates!" <<he>> shouts, <<his>> voice echoing such that you'd be unable to pinpoint it were the priest not stood in front of you. "This night you face the trial of anguish. You will wait here.

The wind has died down, but you find a constant temperature is not a constant struggle. One moment you feel you could endure all night, and the next threatens to overwhelm you. But you perservere.
<br><br>

The bell tolls, sending such a shiver down your spine that you almost lose your footing. "Initiates!" It's Jordan's voice. Perhaps they stood a vigil of their own.
<br><br>

"There is but one challenge remaining." Several <<monks_and_nuns>> emerge from the dark. "It's time for you to drive away this night." Whips emerge from beneath habits. "There are sticks and logs around the cloister. Bring them to the centre. Now!"

"This pyre is for you," <<he>> says. The other <<monks_and_nuns>> form a circle. The strange play of light hides their features. "Throw yourself into the flame and let God judge you."

Sydney mutters something. You can barely hear it. "...only burns away impurity. It doesn't hurt..." Despite <<person6>><<his>> words, <<he>> doesn't look convinced.

Jordan waits for you, and helps you to your feet. "You did very well, child," <<he>> says. "I hope you try again next week."

The light forms into a blinding figure of immense power and beauty. Your delirious mind averts its awareness, ashamed that such vulgar comprehension could behold such a presence.

Something is missing. Tears in the body of this entity match the tears in reality you saw earlier. You can almost see the outline of a whole, as if you've seen it before. A lost arm. A broken wing.
