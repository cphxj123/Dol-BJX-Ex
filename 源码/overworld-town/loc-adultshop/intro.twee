<<He>> sits with you for a while, holding your hand and making small talk. <<His>> voice, and the normalcy of the situation, soon calm you. There's not much time left to get any work done, but <<he>> doesn't seem to mind.

You give Sydney a gentle shove. It barely moves <<him>>, but <<he>> yelps in surprise. "Hey," <<he>> says. "What was that for?"
<br>

<</if>>
<<he>> begins, but stops when <<he>> notices your gaze on the riding crop. <<He>> takes in your posture, and realisation dawns on <<his>> face. <<He>> drops the crop and steps away. You laugh.

<<He>> turns away from you and returns to work, but you suspect it's to hide <<his>> blush.

 You make a tight circle with your forefinger and thumb and, holding it up so Sydney can see, push the beads through the hole, one by one.

Sydney looks away, <<his>> face red. "Th-thank you for the demonstration," you say. "But you should put it away before you're seen." You do so before returning to work.

Sydney passes it to you. You hold it up to your eyes, and run your fingers over its length. "This is indeed a phallus," you say, adopting a level tone. "Very thick, and yet, a human orifice must be able to accommodate it." You nod sagely.
