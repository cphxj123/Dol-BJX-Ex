		Despite <<his>> initial interest in Robin, it's you <<he>> pounces on.

		"Sure," the <<person>> says. Robin keeps <<person1>><<his>> eyes locked on <<his>> feet <span class="red">and shakes <<his>> head.</span>

		You take Robin's hand and try to pull <<him>> away. The <<person2>><<person>> grasps <<person1>><<his>> other arm and tugs. "Mine," the <<person2>><<person>> growls. "Fuck off."
		<br><br>

		You tussle back and forth, until Robin snatches <<person1>><<his>> arm away from the <<person2>><<person>>. The sudden release almost topples you both. Robin clutches your waist. <<person1>><<Hes>> trembling.

		The <<person2>><<person>> glares as you leave the property, but doesn't say anything more.
