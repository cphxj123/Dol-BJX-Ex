:: Town Hall
<<set $outside to 0>><<effects>>

You approach the town hall, a tall building on the precipice. It looms over the rest of the street, and the beach below. The hall proper is locked when not in use, but the mayor's office sits next door.
<br><br>

<<generate1>><<person1>><<generate2>>
You enter a long waiting room, lined with wooden doors. A <<person1>><<person>> sits on the front desk. There's a queue.
<br><br>

<i>It would be pointless to wait in line without a goal in mind.</i>

You wait in line behind a <<person2>><<person>>.

<<if $rng gte 91>>
    <<He>> carries a shaking cage. When <<his>> turn arrives, <<he>> places it on the front desk, but the <<person1>><<person>> shakes <<his>> head. The <<person2>><<person>> leaves with a sullen expression.
    <br><br>
<<elseif $rng gte 81>>
    <<He>> hops from foot to foot. "Can I use the bathroom?" <<he>> says when <<his>> turn arrives.
    <br>
    The <<person1>><<person>> gives <<person2>><<him>> a level stare. "You waited in line for that? There are public toilets outside."
    <br>
    The <<person>> glances around, then leans forward, and whispers. You can't make out the words, but they make the <<person1>><<person>> roll <<his>> eyes, and point to a door on the left. The <<person2>><<person>> rushes through it.

<<elseif $rng gte 71>>
    <<He>> wears a rictus grin. When <<his>> turn arrives, <<he>> speaks without moving <<his>> lips. "Quinn is expecting me."

    <br><br>
    The receptionist pulls the binder closer, opens it, and flips through the pages. You notice torn furniture, a wall with claw marks in it, and a door ripped from its hinges.
    <br><br>
    "I'll send this through to the appropriate department. They'll contact you when they've made a decision."
    <br>
    "How long will that take?"

    <<He>> grumbles, but walks away.

    "I was told to ask for transport."
    <br>
    The receptionist taps something into a computer. "Third door on the right."
    <br><br>
<<elseif $rng gte 21>>
    <<He>> looks around the room with a bemused expression. When <<his>> turn arrives, <<he>> speaks with a foreign accent. "Hello. I'm here to see the mayor. I'm expected."
    <br><br>
    The receptionist waves <<him>> through.
    <br><br>
<<elseif $rng gte 11>>
    <<He>> carries a plant pot containing a single daisy in one hand. "Horticulture," <<he>> says when <<his>> turn arrives. The receptionist nods, and the <<person>> moves along as if <<he>> already knows where <<he>>'s going.
    <br><br>
<<else>>
    <<He>> carries a large stack of paper. When <<his>> turn arrives, <<he>> slams it on the counter. "That's them all filled," <<he>> says with relief.
    <br>
    "Thank you," the receptionist replies. "I'll see that the mayor gets it at once."
    <br>
    <<He>> drops the paper in a bin as soon as the <<person>> turns <<his>> back.

    "There, I knew you could be reasonable." You're suddenly holding £6000, and Quinn is holding the necklace. 
<</if>>
<<He>> proudly puts it on display in the empty case next to <<his>> desk, looking elated. The door clicks again. "You may go. Give Bailey my regards."

You enter the mayor's office. It's as you remember it, full of antique furniture and decor. Quinn isn't here.

    The ivory necklace sits in a case next to the desk. It casts reflected blue light around the room.

    Something on a pedestal next to the desk catches your attention immediately. <span class="blue">A necklace of ivory, set with blue gemstones, casts an eerie reflection in the room.</span> It must be worth a lot.

The case looks far too reinforced for you to be able to take it. You also spot a camera in the corner, slowly sweeping back and forth around the room.
<br><br>

You examine the office more closely. One wall is lined with photographs of the mayor shaking hands with various unknown individuals. The wall opposite boasts a colossal boar head on a mount. The far wall is lined with shelves, full of books.
<br><br>

You wait for the camera to move to the door, away from you. Once it does, you walk around the desk to peek at the mayor's computer screen. A password is needed.

<<npc Quinn 1>><<person1>>
You read through the mayor's emails. <<He>> has a finger in a lot of pies, with messages to and from individuals in every part of town. There are references to a "Dark Elk" project. There's a hint of something illicit here, but Quinn is careful with <<his>> language, and never admits to anything outright.
<br><br>

<<He>> also has conversations with <span class="red">Bailey.</span> The most recent was a few weeks ago. Bailey begins with a simple message:
<i>"I need your people out of the docks next Friday."</i>
<br>
<i>"I know what you're after,"</i> Quinn replies. <i>"And I'm willing to assist, but this just isn't feasible at this time. I'd be pissing in more than one bowl of cereal."</i>
<br>
Bailey replies with a curt, <i>"This isn't a request."</i>
<br>
To which Quinn has written up a lengthy, and detailed, description of where Bailey can shove it. This remains an unsent draft, however. Instead <<he>> replies with a timid <i>"Right."</i>
<br><br>

Quinn has other, similar conversations with Bailey, going back years. Bailey is giving commands, though unsent rants indicate Quinn is unhappy with the situation. Some of them reference a "sin" that Quinn committed, and insist that <<he>>'s long since paid for it.
<br><br>

You hear the door to Quinn's office open, and footsteps march up the stairs. You log off the computer, and take a seat in front of the desk.
<br><br>

<<npc Winter 2>>

Quinn enters, followed by Winter. "Ah," Quinn says. "I wasn't expecting-"
<br>
"It's good you're here," Winter interrupts. With a spring in <<person2>><<his>> step, <<he>> walks up to the desk, and unfurls a map. Quinn frowns at you again, but doesn't question your presence.

You look at the map. You recognise the town and coastline, but the emphasis is on the sea. Many islands are mapped out, including tiny islets.
<br><br>

"You might know of the ancient city some sources refer to," Winter says. "No hard evidence has been found of it, and now I know why." <<He>> rests <<his>> hand on the map, in the middle of the sea. "This used to be land. The city is underwater!"

"We don't have the funds for an ocean excavation," Quinn says. "You should get back to the lake. I hear-"
<br><br>

"The lake led me to this discovery, and I know there are mysteries there still, but a whole city-"
<br><br>

Quinn folds up the map, and thrusts it into Winter's stomach. "You're a credit to your profession. I'll raise this at the next council meeting." <<person1>><<He>> sits down, as if Winter and you are forgotten.

<<He>> draws up <<his>> chest, and marches from the building.
