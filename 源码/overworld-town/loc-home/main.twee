Once finished, you look back up to Kylar. <<His>> eyes lock onto your body. A low whine slips past <<his>> lips. "Let me mark you," <<he>> whispers. <<His>> hands slide across your body again. <br><br>

/*Not in yet*/

You play a fighting game. You struggle to keep up with the move list.

--

You're playing a pixelated war game. Soldiers move across the battlefield in an orderly manner. You're all set for the bloodshed to come as you bark your orders with buttons.

--

A game set in medieval times beckons you with adventure. You spend your time cutting down trees instead.

--

You're astonished at the variety of games that have been purchased on the device. You speculate that Robin didn't want you to get bored or was unaware of what you liked.

--


You play a sports game. One of the players on your team suffers a career-ending injury.

--

You bash and claw at your opponents in a fighting game, leaving you the victor in a tournament ladder.

--

A horror game pits you against yourself. You do well to keep your sanity in an abandoned city.

--

An overarching RPG leaves you a bit confused. You ponder whether you're making the correct choices with an odd cast of characters.

--


An arcade-style hack and slash occupy your time. An entire horde of orcs is no match for your divine strength loaned to you by the Gods.

--

In a fighting game, you frustratingly try to learn a decent combo on a character. It takes some time, but you think you've got it figured out.

--

A first-person shooter's story leaves you pondering about your character's actions. You ignore the implications and continue charging through the arenas.

--

You find an Easter egg in one of your games. The developer thanks you for playing.

--

No soldier is a match for your unstoppable onslaught. Cheater.

"Stupid fucking <<bitch>>." the <<person1>><<person>> says, knocking over a table in <<his>> haste to reach you. "I'm going to enjoy fucking you up." <<He>> clasps a hand over your mouth as the <<person2>><<person>> holds you down.

The pair blame each other for the mishap, and spend a few moments arguing before deciding they can't risk keeping you here. They shove you out the back door, and then a gate, leading to a path running behind the garden.
