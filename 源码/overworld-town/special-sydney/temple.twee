As <<he>> does, you see many cabinets and hangers filled with various chastity devices and other restrictive or punitive equipment, such as blindfolds, belts, gags, and paddles. There's a few metallic pink canisters with cone-shaped nozzles piled up in a corner of the room. The two of you begin to search for keys in the dim light.

Jordan produces a bell from <<person2>><<his>> robes and rings it four times. Sydney quickly attempts to hide <<person1>><<his>> exposure with <<his>> hands. A moment later, four <<person2>><<monks>> enter the room. Two of them bear clear jars full of grey powder, and the other two bring in various cushions, blankets, and candles. They begin to place them on the table, and the candles are lit. All other lights in the room seem to become dimmer.
<br><br>
"Please lie on the altar," Jordan says, placing a hand on your shoulder. You comply, lying on your back, the blankets protecting you from the cold material underneath. The <<monks>> begin softly speaking, but you can't make out their words. "<<nnpc_Brother "Sydney">> Sydney. Please join your beloved on the altar. Take <<pher>> hands in yours, face to face." Sydney hesitates, but complies.

As the wax continues to pour down, it quickly slides off of you and onto the altar. One of the <<person2>><<monks>> begins to collect it in an empty jar. "Release." The restraints retract, freeing you. The <<monks>> help you both up, putting you in a sitting position on the edge of the altar.
<br><br>
"The ritual is done," Jordan says, "but there's just one final step. We must prepare you for your new chastity exams." A <<monk>> approaches you with a jar of grey powder. <<He>> opens it, begins to rub it on your <<genitals>>. You turn away, and see Sydney getting the same treatment from another <<monk>>. After a moment, they scrape the powder away into the jar of melted wax. It begins to sparkle.
<br><br>
"This powder will be used in your exams from now on," Jordan explains as another <<monk>> hands <<him>> a small box. <<He>> opens it, revealing two silver rings. <<He>> gingerly places one on your ring finger, and the other on Sydney's.
<br><br>
"You are bound. Congratulations again." You notice a pair of <<monks>> folding your clothes, before placing them on the altar. "We will give you two some... privacy, and clean up when you're done. The cushions and blankets will be burned to remove any impurities from this site. What you do now, the order will be blinded to." Jordan gives you both a gentle smile, and begins to leave with the other <<monks>>. "I hope you both find happiness in this decision."

You're led through the tunnel and back to the temple. Sydney clings to you the whole way.
<br><br>
<<He>> collapses onto you when you reach the main temple, and begins sobbing. You hold each other for what feels like forever. You can't help but begin to sob yourself, after everything you've been through.
<br><br>
"We... we made it..." <<he>> looks up to you with tears running down <<his>> face. "I love you."
<br><br>
You continue to hold each other. Eventually, though <<he>> still shakes, Sydney stands. "I... I need to go home. <<sydneyMum>> is probably worried sick. I'll... I'll see you tomorrow..." <<He>> walks away, your hands slowly parting from each other. <<He>> looks back to you before leaving the temple, and blows you a weak kiss. <<stress -3>><<lstress>>
