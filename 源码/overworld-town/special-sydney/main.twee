Again?" Sydney turns the book, showing a page defaced with various artwork. <<He>> doesn't seem to notice that one of the drawn figures bears a resemblance to you. Kylar looks down in shame and steps forward, presenting <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> forehead.
			<br><br>
			Sydney uncaps a red marker, and moves Kylar's bangs out of the way with <<his>> other hand. "<span class="purple">Book Criminal >:(</span>" has been written on Kylar's forehead. <<nnpc_He "Kylar">> spends a moment ruffling <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> own hair, before placing the money on the counter, waving at you, and leaving with the textbook again.
