:: Ambient Weather And Seasonal Event Widgets [widget]
/* Bite-sized events based on the current season and weather. Made to be easily expandable, and using the new event pool system.
 * These are all treated as their own event passages, except for the lake, where they happen in addition to any other event. Other locations can be made to follow this behaviour in the future.
 * Exit passage depends on location. Town uses destinationeventend, forest uses the normal forest passage, etc. Called separately from the eventAmbient widget. Further control may be needed in the future, should any of these scenes expand into player choices.
 * Winter events and Snow events are not mutually exclusive. Rain, however, overrides other seasonal event pools. In the future, every season and weather combination could have a unique pool.
 * Future-proofed for snow outside of the Winter season.
